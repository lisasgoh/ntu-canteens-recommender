This programme named "NTU Food Buddy" is created by:
Leong Jing Wen,
Lim Yu Jie,
Lisa Shannon Goh
from NTU BCG1 Sem 1 2018-2019 Group DD2 for the purpose of CZ1003 Mini Project Task.

To run the program, open Runme.py and run the file.
The rest of the modules are stored under the directory "packages" and will be imported by the program where necessary.

Note that this program uses Google API and requires installation of googlemaps module:
	This can be done by installing via the terminal:
		pip install -U googlemaps
*The program will still be able to run without installing googlemaps, but searching by distance to canteens will not be available.
There is a Google API key required for requesting the distance from Google.
	This key has an expiration date and might be disactivated, estimated 1 Jan 2019.
	Searching by distance to canteens will therefore be unavailable.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the application! :)
